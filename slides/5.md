## Updating a contributed Drupal package

Check for updates:

```bash
drush pm-updatestatus

composer outdated drupal/*
```

~Notes:

*   Like Drush, Composer lets you check for updates to Drupal modules.

*   Run:

    ```bash
    composer outdated drupal/*
    ```


Update a package and its dependencies to the latest version:

```bash
composer update drupal/PROJECT_NAME --with-dependencies

drush updatedb
```

~Notes:

*   You can then update your module and any of its dependencies (other modules or libraries) to the latest version.

*   Run:

    ```bash
    composer update drupal/address --with-dependencies
    ```

*   You will want to run `drush updatedb` after this to run any update hooks.
