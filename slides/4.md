## Installing a contributed Drupal package

Install and enable the latest version of the package:

```bash
composer require drupal/PROJECT_NAME

drush pm-enable PROJECT_NAME
```

~Notes:

*   Composer makes it really easy to install Drupal modules and themes. Just run `composer require drupal/PROJECT_NAME`. Let's try installing the Address module with this.

*   Run:

    ```bash
    composer require drupal/address
    ```

*   After you run this, you'll have to enable the Drupal package, either via the UI, Drush, or Drupal Console.
