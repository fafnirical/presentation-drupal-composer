## Creating a new Drupal project with Composer

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>[Download and install Composer]('https://getcomposer.org/download/')</p>
    <p>If you already have Composer installed, update it:</p>
    <pre><code data-trim class="bash">
      composer self-update
    </code></pre>
  </li>
</ol>

~Notes:

*   Composer has an installer. If you go to the link, there are installation steps.

*   I already have it installed, so instead, I'll be making sure it's up-to-date.

*   Run:

    ```bash
    composer self-update
    ```


<ol start="2">
  <li>
    <p>Create a new project with [drupal-composer/drupal-project](https://github.com/drupal-composer/drupal-project):</p>
    <pre><code data-trim class="bash">
      cd /path/above/project/root
      composer create-project \
        drupal-composer/drupal-project:8.x-dev \
        PROJECT-NAME \
        --stability dev \
        --no-interaction
    </code></pre>
  </li>
</ol>

~Notes:

*   To create a new project, you can use the Drupal Composer Project. It's designed to help you get up and running with Drupal and Composer.

*   Run:

    ```bash
    cd "/c"
    composer create-project \
      drupal-composer/drupal-project:8.x-dev \
      seadug-demo \
      --stability dev \
      --no-interaction \
      --no-install
    ```


<ol start="3">
  <li>
    <p>Download non-core Drupal files if they aren't present:</p>
    <pre><code data-trim class="bash">
      cd /path/to/project/root
      composer drupal-scaffold
    </code></pre>
  </li>
</ol>

~Notes:

*   Right now I think there's an open issue in the Drupal Composer Project's issue queue about this.

    Sometimes it won't download the non-core files (like index.php and settings.default.php).

*   Run:

    ```bash
    cd "/c/demo"
    ls
    ```

*   Run:

    ```bash
    composer drupal-scaffold
    ```
