## Removing contributed Drupal packages

Uninstall and remove the package:
```bash
drush pm-uninstall PROJECT_NAME

composer remove drupal/PROJECT_NAME
```

~Notes:

*   To uninstall a Drupal package, you should first disable, or in Drupal 8 terms, uninstall, the package, which you can do via the UI, Drush, or Drupal Console.

*   You can then remove the module from your project's dependencies by running `composer remove`. Let's remove the Address module.

*   Run:

    ```bash
    composer remove drupal/address
    ```
