## Managing patches with Composer

Composer can use [`cweagans/composer-patches`](https://github.com/cweagans/composer-patches) to manage patches

~Notes:

*   I mentioned at the beginning that Composer can help automate patching. The Drupal Composer project comes with a library to manage these patches for you.


## Adding a patch

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Add to the `extras.patches` section in `composer.json`:</p>
    <pre><code data-trim data-noescape class="json">
      {
        // ... rest of composer.json
        "extra": {
          "patches": {
            "drupal/PROJECT_NAME": {
              "Patch name": "https://www.drupal.org/files/issues/filename.patch"
            }
          }
        }
      }
    </code></pre>
  </li>
</ol>

~Notes:

*   To add a patch, we need to modify our `composer.json` file:

*   Run:

    ```bash
    vi composer.json
    ```

*   Add:

    ```json
    "extra": {
      "patches": {
        "drupal/address": {
          "Fix Coding Standard Issues.": "https://www.drupal.org/files/issues/address-fix_coding_standard-2819545-5.patch"
        }
      }
    }
    ```


<ol start="2">
  <li>
    <p>Make sure the patch applies:</p>
    <pre><code data-trim data-noescape class="bash">
      composer update --lock
    </code></pre>
  </li>
</ol>

~Notes:

*   To actually _apply_ the patch locally, we need to update our lockfile. We can run `composer update --lock`.

*   Run:

    ```bash
    composer update --lock
    ```


## Removing a patch

1.  Remove the patch from `composer.json`

2.  Unapply the patch:

    ```bash
    composer update --lock
    ```

~Notes:

*   To remove the patch, we simply remove that patch from `composer.json` and re-run `composer update --lock`.

*   Run:

    ```bash
    vi composer.json
    ```

*   Remove patch.

*   Run:

    ```bash
    composer update --lock
    ```
