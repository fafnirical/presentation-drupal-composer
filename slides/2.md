## Composer vs. Drush

Why use Composer over Drush Make?

*   Used internally by Drupal 8

*   Composer analyzes dependency tree, Drush does not

*   Automated patching

*   Getting off the island

~Notes:

*   Drupal 8 uses Composer to manage its own dependencies, including its various Symfony components

*   Composer analyzes the dependency tree. This means that Composer can calculate the compatibility between modules, libraries, etc. It can also install libraries' dependencies without your having to specify them explicitly.

*   Patching is automated for you. You simply point Composer to the patches to apply, and it applies them. If you update the module, it tells you if the patch fails.

*   The rest of the PHP community uses Composer. Symfony, Laravel, and Magento all use it.
